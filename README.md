# Quo

A programming language designed with mathematical usage in mind. Still in the early stages of development 
but a brief idea of what this language will have is:  
-a rich math library with calculus, probability, premade fibonacci functions, etc.
-a visualization library for statistics and differential equations and the like.
-An easy and fun to use syntax
